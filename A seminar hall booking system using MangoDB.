A Seminar Hall Booking system using MongoDB, Express, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js. I can provide you with an outline of the steps you can follow to complete this project. Here's a suggested approach:
1. Set up the development environment:
   - Install Node.js and MongoDB on your system.
   - Create a new project directory.
2. Backend Development:
   - Initialize a new Node.js project using npm or yarn.
   - Set up the Express.js framework to handle HTTP requests and routes.
   - Implement user authentication and authorization for the admin and department roles.
   - Design and implement the necessary API endpoints for the system modules:
     - Admin:
       - Create an admin account and implement the admin login functionality.
       - Create department accounts.
       - View all bookings.
       - Update booking status (approval/rejection).
       - Send notifications to departments.
     - Department:
       - Implement registration and login functionality for department members.
       - Update booking details.
       - View their own bookings.
3. Database Integration:
   - Connect your application to MongoDB using a suitable Node.js MongoDB driver (e.g., Mongoose).
   - Design the necessary database schemas and models to store data such as users, bookings, and seminar hall details.
   - Implement the required database operations (CRUD) to interact with the data.
4. Frontend Development:
   - Create the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the frontend.
   - Design and implement the user interfaces for the admin and department modules using HTML and CSS.
   - Use JavaScript to handle user interactions and make API calls to the backend.
5. Testing and Debugging:
   - Test your application by creating sample data and performing various actions.
   - Debug any issues or errors that arise during testing.
6. Deployment:
   - Deploy your application to a suitable hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, etc.).
   - Set up any necessary configurations for deployment.
